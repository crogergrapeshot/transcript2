Hi. My name's Lisa Tylenda, and I want to take the next several minutes to talk to you about something very near and dear to all of us. And that's money. [MUSIC PLAYING] When you graduate from high school, how are you going to pay for your cell phone bill? Would you be able to afford more than just a jalopy for a car? And where are you going to live? Living with Mom and Dad at is not very attractive. Even at 25, things get old fast. So let's talk about making money. Imperial Valley College prepared me to make a living. Imperial Valley College prepared me to make a living. Imperial Valley College prepared me to make a living. Imperial Valley College prepared me to make a living. How about you? What are your career goals? Most jobs today require education beyond high school. To compete successfully, you need to be more prepared, and the required education is the most basic step. IVC will prepare you to use new technology required in the workforce. A college education will improve your people skills and help you be more successful in your employment. It's a known fact that college graduates like their jobs better, and they experience more permanent and lasting employment. There are also increased opportunities for job advancement. OK. So I know what some of you are thinking. I'm tired of being stuck in a classroom, listening to the teacher. But that's OK. Because that's where career technical education comes in and saves the day. We call it CTE. It's all about learning and practicing job skills. And it's more than theory. The teaching methods provide hands on learning experience. Best of all, we have internship opportunities that provide students direct contact with future employers. IVC offers tons of CTE educational opportunities, ranging from industrial technologies to business, nursing, agriculture, and many, many more. You respond to a private residence. You have a 82 year old male. Some of our best known programs are actually academies. These students are in a paramedic program, and soon will be saving lives in the Valley. One, two, three, hey! One, two, three, hey! One, two, three, hey! Any of you thinking about going into law enforcement? One of our academies is a peace officer standards and training law enforcement academy. This police academy is one of our most popular programs. IVC is well known for its excellent nursing program. These students are vocational nursing students who soon will be helping to staff our local hospitals and other medical offices in the Valley. For those of you who aren't interested in medical or law enforcement fields, we offer lots more. Our auto technology program trains future technicians who keep our motor vehicles operating. Alternate energy is the next big industry here in the Valley, and IVC is where you can learn all about it. We have an excellent solar energy program that has been opening up job opportunities for many students who want to enter that field. Some of the most popular people in the Valley during the summer are air conditioning repair technicians. Want to become popular quickly? Learn how to fix these units, and go to work for a local air conditioning company. So, as you can see, IVC has lots more to offer you, and I didn't even scratch the surface. There are a lot more programs here that can help you get the training you need to get that ideal job you want. And there are people here who can help you figure out which career path to enter. Well, I got to get to class. So good luck finding your career. And I'll see you around campus. [MUSIC PLAYING]
